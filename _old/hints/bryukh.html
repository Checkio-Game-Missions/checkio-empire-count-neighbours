        I have no idea how to start solving this mission

    <div class="answer">
        One way to check the neighbors is to form a list of "neighbor rules".

<pre class="brush: python">
NEIGHBORS = ((-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1),
              (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1))
</pre>

        I need some help to proceed with the mission
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Prepare a count variable and iterate the list to get the neighboring cells:
<pre class="brush: python">
count = 0
for diff in NEIGHBORS:
    n_row = row + diff[0]
    n_col = col + diff[1]
# you can "unpack diff" inside loop
# for dr, dy in NEIGHBORS:
</pre>
    </div>

        I am gone half way through. Need help!
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Check if the neighboring cell is inside the grid:
<pre class="brush: python">
if 0 <= n_row < len(grid) and 0 <= n_col < len(grid[n_row]):
    # we can use grid[0] for columns in this mission
    ...
</pre>

        I am stuck. I need a small hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        If the new cell is "correct", check if it's "full":
<pre class="brush: python">
if 0 <= n_row < len(grid) and 0 <= n_col < len(grid[n_row]):
    if grid[n_row][n_col]:
        count += 1
# or you can merge it in one "if"
</pre>

    <div class="question">
        I tried all I could. Nothing works. SOS
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Put all the concepts from the previous hints into one function and return
        the "count" for the mission to solve it.
        Be careful with indents, the "if" statement should be under for.
