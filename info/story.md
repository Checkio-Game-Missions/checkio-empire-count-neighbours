For maximum damage, a gunlayer should choose a point where enemies are concentrated.

We'll develop a life-like training program to practice this, based on cellular automata. 
In cellular automata, [the Moore neighborhood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) comprises
the eight cells surrounding a central cell on a two-dimensional square lattice.
The neighborhood is named after Edward F. Moore, the pioneer of cellular automata theory.
