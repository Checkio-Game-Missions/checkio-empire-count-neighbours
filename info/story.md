For the maximum damage a gunlayer should choose a point where enemies are concetrated.

In cellular automata, [the Moore neighborhood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) comprises
the eight cells surrounding a central cell on a two-dimensional square lattice.
The neighborhood is named after Edward F. Moore, a pioneer of cellular automata theory.
Many board games are played with a rectangular grid with squares as cells.
For some games, it is important to know about the conditions of neighbouring cells for chip (figure, draught etc) placement and strategy.
